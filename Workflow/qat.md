# Quality Assurance Testing

*QA focuses on organizational aspects of quality management.*

For each task the developper does, the developper must follow this guideline :
- Review of requirements (we need to analyse requirements to be sure that requirements have been tested).
- Test planning/writing test cases (in collaboration with the product owner, we need to define specific tests cases. To be sure that tests are corehent).
- Unit testing (we must setup unit testing for each feature)
- Integration testing (we provide a github action pipeline to execute tests for each merge)
- Review code (during the merge request, we must notify another developer to do the review of the code. The reviewer will check the **quality of the code**, check the security,..)
