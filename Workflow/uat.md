# User Acceptance Testing

*User Acceptance Testing (UAT), also known as beta or end-user testing, is defined as testing the software by the user or client to determine whether it can be accepted or not.*

# Who performs UAT ?
In our case, first we will be our testers. We will test features after features in daily life in our development environment. In a second case, we will give access to some people (friends) who love Magic the Gathering, to have external opinions.

After receive all feedbacks, if it's all positive, we can deploy the feature in production

# Beta
We plan to launch the beta in mid october/november, with the version v0.1.O.
